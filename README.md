# Isomorph DSL 📐

Isomorph is a bidirectional Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for software architecture diagramming. It bridges the gap between "Architecture as Code" and visual modeling by keeping text (`.isx`) and visual canvas layouts in perfect sync.

## Project Structure
* `/docs` - Academic reports, research, and documentation.
* `/examples` - Syntax mockups and visual counterparts.
* `/parser` - The Isomorph compiler and AST generator (Upcoming).
* `/ui` - The visual canvas and reconciliation engine (Upcoming).
